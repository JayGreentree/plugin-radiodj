SongPoster Plugin for [RadioDJ](http://radiodj.ro)

## What is SongPoster?
Song Poster connects your online radio station to popular social networks.

Basic functionality is posting messages to any or all of the supported platforms, mentioning Artist and Title that just played on your station.

## How can this plugin help?
Basically you can see this as a customized version of the NowPlaying Plugin that ships with RadioDJ.

You just have to enter your UserID and password, select the networks you want to post to and enter a template for the message.
The plugin will build the correct URL and send the message to the webservice on every TrackChange.

Additional Features include 2 different scheduling modes:
* By minutes between two posts
* By number of songs between two posts

Also the plugin can load most of the settings from the autogenerated PAL scripts provided by the webservice.
